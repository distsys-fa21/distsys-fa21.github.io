# Course Project for Distributed Systems

## Requirements

The final project in this course will be open ended.  You will propose, carry out, and report upon a project in groups of two-four students.  Larger groups will be expected to accomplish more.  Projects must have the following elements:

- **System Building** - Your project must involve constructing a software system of some complexity.
If you make use of existing software or packages, then you should be building something substantially new,
and not just plugging a few things together.  Python is recommended as a starting point, but you may use
another language or environment if there is a strong reason to do so.

- **Distributed Techniques** - Your project must make effective use of the techniques discussed in class.
For example, if you have a replicated service, then you should be deliberate about choosing an appropriate
replication technique (primary-backup, peer-to-peer, chain replication, etc) and implement it carefully.
If the performance of your system requires caching, then you should carefully select a consistency model
and implement it faithfully.  If your system is designed to be robust, then you should carefully identify
possible failure modes and design appropriate robustness techniques.

- **Performance Evaluation** - You must evaluate what you have built for both functional correctness and quantitative performance.  For correctness, you must develop a testing procedure that shows that your system operates correctly under all expected conditions.  For performance, you must define an appropriate metric -- latency, bandwidth, throughput -- and measure it across a range of configurations.

- **Communication** - You must present your work cogently by writing a paper and making an oral presentation.  The paper should describe the motivation, architecture, technical details, evaluation methods, and quantitative results of your project.  The oral presentation should summarize the most important aspects of the paper and give a demo of how it works, during the last week of class.

## Project Ideas

# Peer-to-Peer Hash Table

# Distributed Messaging System

# Distributed Task Processing System

# **Distributed Data Preservation System** - Design a peer-to-peer preservation system.
Suppose that a user wishes to preserve a document forever.  If the user delivers
it to any one node in the system, then that node should take active
steps to communicate with other known peers to make further copies of
the document.  Be careful to ensure that the system can recover from
the loss of multiple nodes, but is also not causing continuous unnecessary network traffic.
You may borrow ideas from other systems such as Gnutella
Freenet, or Chord, provided that you implement the system yourself.
Start by reviewing section 4.5.2 in the textbook.

# Reliable Data Delivery System - Build a chained message
queueing system like that described in section 4.3.  It should consist
of a message forwarding process that reads files from a directory and then
delivers them to an identical process running on another machine,
which stores them in a directory where could be read by another
forwarding process.  Make sure that your system can handle expected
failure modes such as server crashes, network outages, full disks.
Evaluate the throughput of your system on a large amount of data.

# **Distributed Game-Playing Engine**

## Milestones

- **Project Proposal** - Turn in a document that describes the overall
shape of your project.  Be sure to include the project partners,
what languages and resources will be necessary to carry it out,
and how you intend to evaluate the work.  The proposal should be
one to two pages of text.  The instructor will follow up with
you to make sure that the project is of appropriate size and difficulty.

- **Progress Report**

- **Class Presentation**

<p>
<li><b>Week of 29 March.</b> - Meet with the instructor to give a demo
of what you have so far.  The project does not have to be complete, but
you must definitely be able to show the main components working, and have
 a plan for finishing the semester.
<p>

Give a fifteen minute in-class
presentation on your project.  (Time may vary once number of projects is known.)
The talk should include an overview of
the goal or problem, a detailed description of the structure of your
system, an example of how your system operates, and an evaluation
of the correctness and performance of your system.
Your talk should be accompanied by 5-10 carefully designed and edited PowerPoint slides.
<p>
<li><b>Wednesday May 5th, Noon</b> - Turn in your code and the final paper.
The code should be structured such that the instructor can build and
execute it independently.  The paper should give an overview of the
goal or the problem, a detailed description of the structure of your
system, including a good diagram where appropriate, and an evaluation
of the correctness and performance of the system.  There is no specific
length requirement; the paper should be long enough to explain all
of the necessary details.  The said, anything less than five pages
is probably too short; anything longer than fifteen pages is probably too long.
<b>Deposit your code and your paper in PDF or DOC format in your dropbox directory.</b>
