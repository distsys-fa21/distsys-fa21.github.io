# Course Project for Distributed Systems

## Requirements

The final project in this course will be open ended.  You will propose, carry out, and report upon a project in groups of **two*** students.
Projects must have the following elements:

- **Build a New System** - Your project must involve constructing a system of some complexity
that deals with some of the challenging problems of distributed systems, such as reliability, consistency,
replication, and so forth. If you make use of existing software or packages, then you must build something
substantially new on top, and not just plug a few things together. Python is recommended as a starting point, but you may use
another language or environment if there is a strong reason to do so.

- **Evaluate its Performance** - The performance of your system must be evaluated carefully, in
a manner appropriate to the nature of the system.  For example, if your system is designed to be
scalable, then you should evaluate throughput and latency as the number of nodes increases.
Or, if it is designed to be reliable, then you should evaluate its performance when nodes fail.
Or, if it is designed to be consistent, then you should evaluate the latency of update propagation
under various conditions.  Think carefully about the appropriate evaluation for your system.

- **Present it Clearly** - Present your work cogently by writing a paper and making an oral presentation.
The paper should describe the motivation, design, evaluation methods, and quantitative results of your project.
The oral presentation should summarize the most important aspects of the paper and give a demo of how it works,
during the last week of class.

## Project Ideas

Following are some ideas to get you thinking.  You are welcome to modify one of these ideas,
or to pick a different problem.

# Peer-to-Peer Hash Table

# Distributed Messaging System

# Distributed Task Processing System

# **Distributed Data Preservation System** - Design a peer-to-peer preservation system.
Suppose that a user wishes to preserve a document forever.  If the user delivers
it to any one node in the system, then that node should take active
steps to communicate with other known peers to make further copies of
the document.  Be careful to ensure that the system can recover from
the loss of multiple nodes, but is also not causing continuous unnecessary network traffic.
You may borrow ideas from other systems such as Gnutella
Freenet, or Chord, provided that you implement the system yourself.
Start by reviewing section 4.5.2 in the textbook.

# Reliable Data Delivery System - Build a chained message
queueing system like that described in section 4.3.  It should consist
of a message forwarding process that reads files from a directory and then
delivers them to an identical process running on another machine,
which stores them in a directory where could be read by another
forwarding process.  Make sure that your system can handle expected
failure modes such as server crashes, network outages, full disks.
Evaluate the throughput of your system on a large amount of data.

# **Distributed Game-Playing Engine**

## Milestones

- **Project Proposal - Friday, October 15th** -
Turn in a document that describes the overall shape of your project.
This should include the project partners, a high level description
of the goals and structure of the system, identification of the key
"distributed system" problem in the system, 
what languages and resources will be necessary to carry it out,
and your plan for evaluating the system.  The proposal should be
about two full pages of text.  The instructor will follow up with
you to make sure that the project is of appropriate size and difficulty.

**Progress Report**

**Class Presentation**  During the penultimate week of class, you
will give a ten minute presentation to the whole class.
(Time may vary once number of projects is known.)
The talk should include an overview of the goal or problem, the structure of your
system, an example of how your system operates, and your results from evaluating
the system so far. Your talk should be accompanied by 5-10 carefully designed
and edited slides.  While this is a short talk, it will require careful preparation
in order to be detailed, informative, and on time.

**Final Submission - Tuesday, December 7th** - Turn in your code and the final paper.
The code should be structured such that the instructor can build and
execute it independently.  The paper should give an overview of the
goal or the problem, a detailed description of the structure of your
system, including a good diagram where appropriate, and an evaluation
of the correctness and performance of the system.  There is no specific
length requirement; the paper should be long enough to explain all
of the necessary details.  The said, anything less than five pages
is probably too short; anything longer than fifteen pages is probably too long.
** Deposit your code and your paper in PDF or DOC format in your dropbox directory. **
