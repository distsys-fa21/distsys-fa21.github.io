# A1 - Measurement Basics

Start by following the [general instructions](general) for assignments
to set up your Python environment appropiately.

The first assignment will be a warm up in which you conduct a careful
measurement of the costs of basic operations in distributed systems.
To that end, write a series of small Python programs that measure the time to do the following things on the student machines:

- Make a trivial function call.
- Create/delete a file in your home directory.
- Create/delete a file in `/tmp`
- Get the current wall clock time.
- Insert an item into a Python dictionary.
- Make a TCP connection to a well-known internet service and close it.
- Make an HTTP connection to a well-known website, read back the HTML, and then close it.
- Open a file containing a large JSON document, and parse it into memory.  (Check out [json-generator.com](http://www.json-generator.com).)
- Use `scandir` to iterate over all the items in your home directory and `stat` each one to measure its size.
- Run `ls -l` as a subprocess to accomplish the same thing.

Of course, there is little value in measuring a <i>single</i>
one of these items, one of which may be faster than the resolution
of the clock.  So, measure how long it takes a number of items
in a loop, such that the loop takes somewhere between one and three
seconds.  (You will have to experiment with the proper number of
loop iterations for each test, since the times will vary widely.)

Each test program should run without arguments, carry out its
measurement silently, and then report the elapsed time, number
of operations, average time per operation, fastest single operation,
and slowest single operation.

## Turning In

Turn in each of your Python programs, naming them `Test1.py`, `Test2.py`, ... corresponding to the numbering above.  Also turn in a concise lab report written in plain text called `REPORT` that indicates:
- The outputs of each of the tests you ran.
- Which test has the fastest average, the slowest average, and the broadest range of performance.
- Explain the underlying reasons for the performance differences.

See the [general instructions](general) for how to turn in your materials.
