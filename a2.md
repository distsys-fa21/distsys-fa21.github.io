# A2 - Remote Procedure Call

In this assignment, you will build a simple server that supports
access to an in-memory hash table running on a single machine.
This will provide the basic capability that we will build upon over
several assignments to work up to a fully distributed, scalable hash table.
The focus of this assignment will be on the remote procedure call (RPC)
interface to the system.

## Requirements

You will build a client and server program that work together to
implement a hash table access via RPC.  The client
program must contain four methods that appear to the caller as local
function calls, but instead work by sending a request to the server
and awaiting a response.  On the server side, the server will accept
requests from the client, translate them into operations on
ordinary local functions, and send an appropriate response.

For this first assignment, the server will simply keep a hash table
in memory and need only support a single client at a time.
You will be adding more complexity in later assignments, one at a time.

## Hash Table Interface

Your hash table server should support the following four operations:

```
insert( key, value ) -> returns success or failure
lookup( key ) -> returns a value
remove( key ) -> returns success or failure
scan( regex ) -> returns all (key,value) pairs where the key matches the regular expression 
```

Across the calls, a key may be a plain string with arbitrary contents, a value can be an arbitrary JSON document, and the regex must be a string that is a valid [Python regex](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html).

You should design an appropriate set of JSON messages to represent a request and response for each operation.  You can define this however you like, as long
as it is consistent and works correctly. For example, a request to insert an item might look like this:

```
{
"method" : "insert",
"key" : "zebra",
"value" : { "weight":100, "name":"fred" }
}
```

In a similar way, the server will return a brief JSON message to indicate
the result of the operation.  Keep in mind that both the client and server
should be able to distinguish between a successful operation, a failed
operation, and a completely invalid request.  You should have return
messages for each of these cases.

## General Code Structure

To ensure some degree of consistency across the projects, please follow this structure in your code:

- **HashTable.py** should contain the basic implementation of each of the four operations on a plain hash table in memory, and forms part of the server.
- **RPCServer.py** should contain the server-side RPC main program.
It should create a listening TCP socket, display the host and port it is
listening on, accept incoming connections, decode messages coming from the
client, invoke the proper operation, and then return the result.
-  **RPCClient.py** should contain the client-side RPC operations.
It should provide a method to connect to a server host and port,
and a client-stub for each of the four hash table operations that sends
a message and waits for the response.  
-  One or more client main programs named `TestXYZ.py` should make use
of RPCClient.py to connect to the server and invoke RPC operations as needed.

## Testing and Measurement

Evaluate the performance of your RPC service in a similar way as the
first measurement assignment.  Write several test programs that exercise
the four key operations in the hash table interface in various combinations.  The exact design of these tests is up to you, keeping in mind that performance may be affected by the number of items in the table.

As with the previous assignment, keep track of the elapsed time,
number of operations, average, slowest, and fastest operation,
computed over a large number of measurements.

## What to Turn In

Turn in all of your source code, along with a lab report titled `REPORT`
that describes the following in detail:
- Detailed examples of the messages used for each request and responses.
- Your approach to measuring the performance of the system.
- The results of your performance measurements.
- A discussion of the significance of your results, noting how they compare to the results your observed in the prior assignments.
